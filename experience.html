            <p>
                I was part of the team responsible for communication between different applications in the bank currently
                done overwhelmingly using JMS technology. My role was partly to develop proof of concept for migrating the infrastructure
                deployed on the physical servers to the container based one using Docker and Openshift platform, and partly to support the team
                (which had mostly operational/infrastructure background) with my Java expertise in improvements to their existing applications.

            <p>
                The project was a continuation of a project I was in still as part of a Zuhlke team. The application is an internal tool to be used as
                a framework for tasks workflow for client relationship managers to manage tasks coming from different platforms. The goal of this phase of the project was to prepare the application interfaces to receive tasks directly from other applications via JMS. The development team was consisting of two people, and I was responsible for everything related to the backend, including the database.
